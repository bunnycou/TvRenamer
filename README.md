## A Python project to rename a folder of episodes for plex

I wanted to try to incorporate grabbing episode titles from the filename if it existed but that just isn't possible in my experience, too many different file naming formats to deal with and it doesn't matter if it goes into plex. I could also reference a database but that requires the user to input the exact name the database uses which would be annoying.

In the end I opted for the simple extra info option which I often just put '1080p' into.
